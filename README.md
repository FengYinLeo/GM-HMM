# GM-HMM

The fatigue experienced by navigational officers unfolds in intricate temporal sequences with interdependencies. Addressing the prevalent deficiency of fragmenting fatigue states in most seafarer fatigue investigations, a novel approach for fatigue detection of navigational officer is proposed: the Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GM-HMM). This innovation aims to identify the fatigue dynamics of navigational officers by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) data obtained from the bridge simulator, alongside the dynamic characteristics inherent in ship navigating fatigue. The GM-HMM model operates within a probabilistic framework to discern the fatigue states of navigational officers, capitalizing on the physiological insights gleaned from EEG signals. Empirical evidence underscores the heightened efficacy of the GM-HMM model in fatigue detection, as contrasted with the traditional logistic regression model. Consequently, this model not only enhances the efficacy of shipborne real-time fatigue warning systems but also mitigates the maritime perils stemming from human factors, which might otherwise precipitate accidents of considerable consequence.
